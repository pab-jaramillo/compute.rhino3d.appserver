MODULE GROWING LOGIC
The main idea is to generate a simple aggregation based on the number of persons inside the Space Station. This example shows how the spaces grow depending the number of individuals
Our group is using inflatable ofbjects inside the recreation-sport modules, therefore once designed I'll implement the number of objects to be deploy in relation with the number of pople

User Imputs:
- Number of people inside space as an Int.
- Number of open faces as windows (Not yet).
- Size of window aperture (Not yet).
- Inflatable interior objects (Not yet).

Outputs:
- Geometry
- The modules will have different colours to differentiate the activity inside the module
- The inflatable objects in the interior will also have different materials

NO PLUGINS (THOUHG IS NOT DEPLOYING, I'M RECEIVING THE 500 ERROR)
